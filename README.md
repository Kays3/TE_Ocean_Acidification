# TE_Ocean_Acidification
Part of the thesis work on TE transcriptomics for Ocean Acidification.

Overview
Climate change is an unavoidable threat to the global environment.
 Many studies have confirmed that climate change causes ocean warming and a rise in acidity inevitably, events like coral bleaching and loss of biodiversity1. The rapidly changing environment will likely continue to affect the oceans, thus pushing marine organisms to adapt to new harsh conditions. In particular, coral reef fish crucial for the ocean ecosystem may need to develop adaptation mechanisms to rising ocean acidity or go extinct.
